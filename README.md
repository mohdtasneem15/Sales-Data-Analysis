We're diving into Walmart's sales data to figure out which stores and products are performing best, how sales change over time, and what customers are doing. The idea is to use these insights to improve Walmart's sales strategies.
We're using information from a bunch of Walmart stores in different places. This data tells us what was sold, when it was sold, and how much it cost. It also includes details about the people who bought stuff and special sales that happened around holidays.
