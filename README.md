We're diving into Walmart's sales data to figure out which products are performing best, how sales change over time, and examine customer behavior. The idea is to use these insights to improve Walmart's sales strategies.

We're using information from a bunch of Walmart stores in different places. This data tells us what was sold, when it was sold, and how much it cost.here's also data about special sales events around holidays, which can be tricky to analyze because they affect sales in different ways.
