# Technique
## 1.Cleaning Up the Data

The first step was to examine the data carefully to find any missing or incorrect information. We made sure all the data was complete and accurate before moving on.

## 2.Organizing the Data

We created a database and stored the information in a structured way. This made it easier to work with and analyze the data.

## 3.Adding More Information

### To get a better understanding of when and how sales happened, we added new details to the data:

a.Time of day: We figured out if sales happened in the morning, afternoon, or evening.

b.Day of the week: We determined which day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) the sale occurred.
c.Month: We identified the month when the sale took place.

These extra details will help us see when sales are highest and which days or times are busiest for the store.
